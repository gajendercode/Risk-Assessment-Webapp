0,CVE-2018-0334,"A vulnerability in the certificate management subsystem of Cisco AnyConnect Network Access Manager and of Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client for iOS, Mac OS X, Android, Windows, and Linux could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass the TLS certificate check when downloading certain configuration files. The vulnerability is due to improper use of Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol and improper server certificate validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by preparing malicious profile and localization files for Cisco AnyConnect to use. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to remotely change the configuration profile, a certificate, or the localization data used by AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvh23141.",4.8,2.2,2.5
1,CVE-2018-0373,"A vulnerability in vpnva-6.sys for 32-bit Windows and vpnva64-6.sys for 64-bit Windows of Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client for Windows Desktop could allow an authenticated, local attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied data. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious request to the application. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition on the affected system. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvj47654.",5.5,1.8,3.6
2,CVE-2018-0387,"A vulnerability in Cisco Webex Teams (for Windows and macOS) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the user's device, possibly with elevated privileges. The vulnerability occurs because Cisco Webex Teams does not properly sanitize input. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a user a malicious link and persuading the user to follow the link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the user's system. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvh66250.",8.8,2.8,5.9
3,CVE-2018-0422,"A vulnerability in the folder permissions of Cisco Webex Meetings client for Windows could allow an authenticated, local attacker to modify locally stored files and execute code on a targeted device with the privilege level of the user. The vulnerability is due to folder permissions that grant a user the permission to read, write, and execute files in the Webex folders. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to write malicious files to the Webex client directory, affecting all other users of the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow a user to execute commands with elevated privileges. Attacks on single-user systems are less likely to occur, as the attack must be carried out by the user on the user's own system. Multiuser systems have a higher risk of exploitation because folder permissions have an impact on all users of the device. For an attacker to exploit this vulnerability successfully, a second user must execute the locally installed malicious file to allow remote code execution to occur.",7.3,1.3,5.9

203,CVE-2018-11101,"Open Whisper Signal (aka Signal-Desktop) through 1.10.1 allows XSS via a resource location specified in an attribute of a SCRIPT, IFRAME, or IMG element, leading to JavaScript execution after a reply, a different vulnerability than CVE-2018-10994. The attacker needs to send HTML code directly as a message, and then reply to that message to trigger this vulnerability. The Signal-Desktop software fails to sanitize specific HTML elements that can be used to inject HTML code into remote chat windows when replying to an HTML message. Specifically the IMG and IFRAME elements can be used to include remote or local resources. For example, the use of an IFRAME element enables full code execution, allowing an attacker to download/upload files, information, etc. The SCRIPT element was also found to be injectable. On the Windows operating system, the CSP fails to prevent remote inclusion of resources via the SMB protocol. In this case, remote execution of JavaScript can be achieved by referencing the script on an SMB share within an IFRAME element, for example: <IFRAME src=\\DESKTOP-XXXXX\Temp\test.html> and then replying to it. The included JavaScript code is then executed automatically, without any interaction needed from the user. The vulnerability can be triggered in the Signal-Desktop client by sending a specially crafted message and then replying to it with any text or content in the reply (it doesn't matter).",6.1,2.8,2.7

The MOV to SS and POP SS instructions inhibit interrupts (including NMIs), data breakpoints, and single step trap exceptions until the instruction boundary following the next instruction (SDM Vol. 3A; section 6.8.3). (The inhibited data breakpoints are those on memory accessed by the MOV to SS or POP to SS instruction itself.) Note that debug exceptions are not inhibited by the interrupt enable (EFLAGS.IF) system flag (SDM Vol. 3A; section 2.3). If the instruction following the MOV to SS or POP to SS instruction is an instruction like SYSCALL, SYSENTER, INT 3, etc. that transfers control to the operating system at CPL < 3, the debug exception is delivered after the transfer to CPL < 3 is complete.
